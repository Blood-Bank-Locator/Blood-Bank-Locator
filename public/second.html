            <h1>What is Meant by Blood Transfusion? <br> Why are Blood Banks Important?</h1>
            <p class="p1"> 
                Ideally, blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood components from one person (donor) into the bloodstream of another person (recipient). <br> It comes into play especially as a life-saving process for the recipient when there’s a considerable loss of blood cells through bleeding or depression of the bone marrow. Blood transfusion is believed to be a noble cause.
                <br>
                Blood bank services act as the universal point as they collect, test, and store all types of blood. They carefully screen test the blood for any signs of  <br> Other than screening for infections, they also check the blood type if it’s type A, B, AB, or O and whether it’s Rh-negative or Rh-positive.
                <br>
                Note: If your blood type is “O-negative”, you’re the universal donor who can transfer your blood to nearly everyone and if your blood type is “AB-positive”, you act as universal recipients. However, any mismatch between the blood types can prove fatal, so blood tests must be done, carefully.
